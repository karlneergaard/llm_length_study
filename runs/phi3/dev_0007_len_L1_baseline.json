      "reply": "NO. An odd number cannot be divided evenly by an even number. This is because an odd number has a remainder of 1 when divided by 2, while an even number has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2. Therefore, when an odd number is divided by an even number, the result will always have a remainder, making it an improper division."
