      "reply": "Yes, magnesium citrate does contain citric acid. Magnesium citrate is a compound that consists of magnesium, citric acid, and water. It is often used as a laxative to relieve occasional constipation. The citric acid in magnesium citrate helps to draw water into the intestines, which can help to soften stools and promote bowel movements."
