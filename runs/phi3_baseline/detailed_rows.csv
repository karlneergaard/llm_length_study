The derivative of a continuous function is always continuous. This is a result of the differentiability of continuous functions. If a function is continuous on an interval, and differentiable on that interval, then its derivative exists at every point in that interval.

The sum of all numbers on a roulette wheel depends on the type of roulette being played. In European roulette, the wheel has numbers from 0 to 36, which adds up to 676.

In thermodynamics, an adiabatic process is one in which no heat is transferred to or from the system by its surroundings. The term ""adiabatic"" literally means ""impassable,"" referring to the fact that heat cannot pass into or out of the system.

Ion–dipole interactions and hydrogen bonds are both types of intermolecular forces, but they differ in strength and the nature of the interactions.

The speed of sound in a medium is primarily determined by the properties of the medium itself, such as its density and elasticity. At a constant temperature, the speed of sound in a given medium does not vary with frequency. This is because the speed of sound is a function of the medium's properties, not the frequency of the sound wave.

The set of natural numbers is a fundamental concept in mathematics, often defined as the set of positive integers starting from 1. This definition can vary slightly depending on the mathematical context or cultural conventions. In some definitions, the set of natural numbers includes zero (0), while in others, it starts from one (1).

Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, does not stay at a constant distance from the Sun throughout its orbit. Instead, it follows an elliptical orbit, which means its distance from the Sun varies.

The Titius–Bode rule is an empirical formula that was once thought to predict the spacing of planets in the Solar System. It suggests that, starting with the innermost planet, each planet is approximately twice as far from the Sun as the previous one. However, this rule is not a physical law and does not accurately describe the orbits of exoplanetary systems. Exoplanet",1.873,i,FALSE,,,idk,i don't know,FALSE,TRUE,
